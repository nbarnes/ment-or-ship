Overview
========

A tracking program to allow the user to keep track of the list of parts any
item requires for construction, as well as the list of item recipes a given
part is a member of.

To-Do
=====

Accessing the parts index is only possible through entering the url in the
address bar of your browser; http://localhost:3000/items

Only the listing functionality is in place.  The 'add new' links in the lists
are stubs.
